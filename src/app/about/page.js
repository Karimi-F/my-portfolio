                    Hi, I'm Karimi Fridah ðŸ‘‹ I'm a full-stack web developer with a
                    passion for EdTech and making education more engaging through
                    technology. With expertise in React, Next.js, Flask, and PostgreSQL,
                    I love building scalable applications that enhance learning
                    experiences. My journey into web development started with a
                    curiosity for how technology can transform education, and now I'm
                    dedicated to creating user-friendly solutions that empower learners
                    and educators. When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me learning
                    Mandarin, doing calisthenics, or documenting my journey online. I
                    believe in continuous learning and love exploring new ideas. Let's
                    connect! If youâ€™re working on something exciting in EdTech or web
                    development, I'd love to chat. Reach out via [LinkedIn/email].
